          <li><strong>Tax Receipts:</strong> For eligible donations, we will issue tax receipts in accordance with Canadian tax laws.</li>
          <li><strong>Administration Fee:</strong> A small portion of each donation (typically 10-15%) may be allocated to cover our administrative and operational costs, ensuring the sustainability of our charitable work. This is clearly indicated during the donation process.</li>
          <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> We will use our best efforts to distribute your donation as specified, but reserve the right to redirect funds if the designated program is overfunded or to address more urgent needs.</li>

          We use industry-standard security measures to protect your financial information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
