          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Your Sadaqah Can Fund a Water Pump This Year – My Sadaqah Online</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Around the world, millions of people wake up each day without access to clean and safe water. For many, fetching water means walking miles under the hot sun to reach a distant, often unsafe source. This daily struggle affects health, education, and quality of life—especially for women and children.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            But there is a simple, powerful way to make a difference. <strong>Your Sadaqah can fund a water pump this year</strong> and bring clean water directly to those who need it most.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            With <strong>My Sadaqah Online</strong>, you can easily turn your charity into a lasting gift.

        <!-- Why Water Pumps Matter -->
        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Why Water Pumps Matter</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Clean water is a basic human need, yet it remains out of reach for too many. Lack of access to safe water leads to:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <li><strong>Serious health risks</strong> from waterborne diseases</li>
            <li><strong>Missed education</strong> as children—especially girls—spend hours collecting water</li>
            <li><strong>Daily hardship</strong> for families just trying to meet basic needs</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            A single water pump can change all of that. It provides a reliable source of clean water for drinking, cooking, and washing—benefiting entire communities for years.

        <!-- Sadaqah as a Source of Lasting Good -->
        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Sadaqah as a Source of Lasting Good</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            In Islam, <strong>Sadaqah</strong> is a voluntary act of charity given out of compassion, love, or generosity. It brings reward not only to the giver but to everyone who benefits.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Even greater is <strong>Sadaqah Jariyah</strong>—ongoing charity that continues to benefit people over time.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            A water pump is a perfect example of this. Every time someone uses the water, the donor receives reward. It's a legacy of kindness that keeps giving, even long after it's built.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            We've made it simple for anyone to fund a water pump in just a few easy steps:
          </p>
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <li><strong>Visit our website</strong> and choose the "Water Pump" project</li>
            <li><strong>Select your location</strong>—we work in water-scarce areas across Africa and Asia</li>
            <li><strong>Decide your contribution</strong>—fund a full pump or share the cost with others</li>
            <li><strong>Make your donation securely</strong> through our trusted online platform</li>
            <li><strong>Receive updates</strong> and a completion report once your pump is installed</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Our process is transparent, Shariah-compliant, and donor-focused. You'll know exactly how your Sadaqah is used.

        <!-- Real Lives Changed -->
        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Real Lives Changed Through Your Giving</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Thanks to donors like you, we've installed water pumps in remote villages where clean water was once a dream.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            One such pump in rural Pakistan now provides fresh water to over 40 families. Mothers no longer have to walk long distances, and children attend school without interruption. Communities are cleaner, healthier, and more hopeful.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            These are the kinds of changes your Sadaqah can make.
